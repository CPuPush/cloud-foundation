! Cost Optimization Pillar

? Cost Optimization pillar â€“eliminate unneeded expense
focus
  * Avoid unnecessary costs
key topics
  * Understanding and controlling where money is being spent
  * Selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types
  * Analyzing spend over time
  * Scaling to meeting business needs without overspending

? Cost Optimization design principles
  * Implement Cloud Financial Management
To achieve financial success and accelerate business value realization in the cloud, you need to invest in cloud financial management and cost optimization. You need to build capability through knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes to become a cost-efficient organization
  * Adopt a consumption model
Pay only for the computing resources that you require. Increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements, not by using elaborate forecasting.
  * Measure overall efficiency
Measure the business output of the workload and the costs that are associated with delivering it. Use this measure to know the gains that you make from increasing output and reducing costs
  * Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
AWS does the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers, which meansthat you can focus on your customers and business projects instead of the IT infrastructure.
  * Analyze and attribute expenditure
The cloud makes it easier to accurately identify system usage and costs, and attribute IT costs to individual workload owners. Having this capability helps you measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs
