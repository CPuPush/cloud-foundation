* => The Operational Excellence pillar focuses on the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value,and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. Key topics include: automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.

? operational Excellence design principles
  * Perform operation as code
  * make frequent, small, reversible changes
  * refine operations procedures frequently
  * anticipate failure
  * learn from all operational events and failures

* there are 5 design principle for operating excellence in the cloud:
perform operations as code 
* Define your entire workload (that is, applications and infrastructure) as code and update it with code. Implement operations procedures as code and configure them to automatically trigger in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and enable consistent responses to events.
make frequent, small, reversible changes
* Design workloads to enable components to be updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail (without affecting customers when possible)
refine operations procedures frequently
* Look for opportunities to improve operations procedures. Evolve your procedures appropriately as your workloads evolve. Set up regular game days to review all procedures, validate their effectiveness, and ensure that teams are familiar with them
anticipate failure
* Identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure that they are effective and that teams know how to run them. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to simulated events.
Learn from all operational failures
* Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures. Share what is learned across teams and through the entire organization.

? Operational excellence questions
* Organization
  * how do you determine what your priorities are?
  * how do you structure your organization to support your business outcomes?
  * how does your organizational culture support your business outcomes?
* Prepare
  * how do you design your workload so that you can understand it state?
  * how do you reduce defets, ease remediation, and improve flow into productions?
  * how do you mitigate deployment risks?
  * how do you that you are ready to support a workload?
* Operate
  * How do you understand the health of your workload?
  * how do you understand the health of your operations?
  * how do you manage workload and operations events?
* evolve
  * how do you evolve operations?
