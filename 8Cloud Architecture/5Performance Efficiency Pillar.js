? Performance Efficiency pillar â€“use resources sparingly
Focus
  * Use IT and computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
Key topics
  * Selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements
  * Monitoring performance
  * Making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve

* => The Performance Efficiency pillar focuses on the ability to use IT and computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes or technologies evolve. Key topics include: selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve

? Performance efficiency design principles
  * Democratize advanced technologies
Consume technologies as a service. For example, technologies such as NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning require expertise that is not evenly dispersed across the technical community. In the cloud, these technologies become services that teams can consume. Consuming technologies enables teams to focus on product development instead of resource provisioning and management
  * Go global in minutes
Deploy systems in multiple AWS Regions to provide lower latency and a better customer experience at minimal cost
  * Use serverless architectures
Serverless architectures remove the operational burden of running and maintaining servers to carry out traditional compute activities. Serverless architectures can also lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale
  * Experiment more often
Perform comparative testing of different types of instances, storage, or configurations
  * Consider mechanical sympathy
Use the technology approach that aligns best to what you are trying to achieve. For example, consider your data access patterns when you selectapproaches fordatabases or storage.
