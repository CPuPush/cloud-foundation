! Compute Services Overview

? AWS compute Service
* AWS EC2 => provides resiable virtual machines
* Amazon EC2 Auto Scalling => Supports application availability by allowing you to define conditions that will automatically launch or terminate EC2 Instances
* Amazon ECR => is used to store and retrieve docker image
* Amazon ECS => a container or orchestration service that support docker
* VMware cloud on AWS => enables you to provision a hybrid cloud without custom hardware
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk => provides a simple way to run and manage web applications
* AWS Lambda => is a serverless compute solution. You pay only for the compute time that you use
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) => Enables you to run managed kubernetes on AWS
* Amazon lightsail => prorvides a simple-to-use service for building an application or website
* AWS batch => provides a tool for running batch jobs at any scale
* AWS fargate => provides a way to run containers that reduce the need for you to manage servers or clusters
* AWS outposts => Provides a way to run select AWS services in your on-premises data center
* AWS Serverless Application Repository => Provides a way to discover, deploy, and publish serverless application.

? Choosing The Optimal Compute Service
The optimnal compute service tha you use will depend on your use case
* some aspect to cosider 
  TODO    what is your application design?
  TODO    What are your usage patterns?
  TODO    Which configuration settings will you want to manage?
* selection the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency
  * a good starting place--understand the available compute options
